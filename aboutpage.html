    <h1>what is this website?</h1>
    <p>This is the website of the artist MochaWolfroo. A small artist who draws cartoon animals on his freetime. MochaWolfroo refers to the character and not specifically the artist. MochaWolfroo can also refer to the Name of the buisness that is used to sell this artwork. Currently commissions are closed, but openings will be annnounced on my twitter.</p>
    <!--<h2>Who is MochaWolfroo?</h2>

    <img id="aboutwolfroo" src="Images/Feelin-roo'd.png" alt="Mocha the Wolfroo">
    <div>

        <p> Mocha is the character shown above. He is a mix of a kangaroo and a brown wolf. Mocha is 8'2" (or ~2.8 meters) in height. He is roughly 650 lbs in his taur state.</p>

    <h2> Okay, Mocha is the Character, Who is the Artist? </h2>
    <p> That would be the same person as who made this website. Due to privacy concerns, I will not disclose my full name, but my first name is Ben. I am a novice web dev and a digital artist who like to draw characters like Mocha and Mythical creatures as well. I work on art like this part time and I have a part time day job as well.<p>
