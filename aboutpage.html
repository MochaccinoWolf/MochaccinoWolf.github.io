        <h1>what is this website?</h1>
          <p>This is the website of the artist MochaWolfroo. A small artist who draws cartoon animals on his freetime. MochaWolfroo refers to the character and not specifically the artist.</p>
          <h2>Who is MochaWolfroo?</h2>
        <img id="aboutwolfroo" src="Images/Feelin-roo'd.jpg" alt="Mocha the Wolfroo">
          <div>
            <p> Mocha is the character shown above. He is a mix of a kangaroo and a brown wolf. Mocha is 8'2" (or ~2.8 meters) in height. He is roughly 650 lbs in his taur state.</p>
          </div>
          <h2> Okay, Mocha is the Character, Who is the Artist? </h2>
            <p> That would be the same person as who made this website. Due to privacy concerns, I will not disclose my full name, but my fist name is Benjamin. I am a novice web dev and a digital artist who like to draw characters like Mocha and Mythical creatures as well.<p>
