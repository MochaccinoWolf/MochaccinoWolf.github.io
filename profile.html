               Hello! My name is Mocha. <br>
               Born in Michigan, I now reside in Ohio. I have been drawing since the age of 11. I love to draw fantasy creatures such as dragons, centaurs and anthropomorphic animals! I have been in the fandom since 2016, but I got my start online drawing pokemon art in 2014. One of my biggest artist inspirations is Aaron Blaise, a former disney artist for movies like Brother Bear and The Lion King. I also had inspiration from Disney's Robin Hood, Marvel, DC, as well as Nintendo and PlayStation Franchises, such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

               I like to do a lot of things on my free time, sometimes I have too many options! I like to Stream, Game, Code, and hang out with friends either online or in person. Some of my favorite games to play are platformers, puzzle games, and Space simulators. I also love finding games that have a fresh idea with story and mechanincs. 
               <br>
               <br>
               Personality wise, I am a bit timid when it comes to speaking out to new people and visiting new places. I love to travel, I love to see new sights and meet new people.
