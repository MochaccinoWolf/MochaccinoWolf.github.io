                <!--my introduction-->
               Hello people! Weclome to my own personal website. I built it from everything Ive learned from my school this semester. 
                <br />It has taken alot of trial and error and research for it to be where it is today. I made this so I can have a place to call my own. I am currently using the website github to host my website becasue it is the best option given my current situations, hopefully I will be able to upgrade to a custom domain sometime in the future. <br />

                    Please not that this is not a very polished version of the website! Anyway, here I will have some tabs up abover where you can click to take you to some other parts of the site, like my gallery or social media. Once I learn
                    about APIs I will add a picarto API so the streams will play here as well! for now, feel free to have a nice look around!
