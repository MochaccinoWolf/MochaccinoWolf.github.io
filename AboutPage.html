                Mocha is a hybrid of a Kangaroo and a wolf, making what is known as a wolfroo. Despite being of the male gender, Mocha has a pouch on his torso, and although it is deep it is not bottomless.

            <h4>What Qualities of each side does Mocha inherit?</h4>
            <p>
               Excellent question! Well, his traits are a bit complicated. First of all, lets begin with the Kangaroo side. <br />Kangaroo:<br />

                <ul>
                    <li> Mocha has a pouch to hold his belongings in; Like a natural, attached pocket </li>
                    <li> Mocha has big, roo-like feet, which makes perfect for seamless hopping around and higher jumping ability. The highest Mocha has jumped is about 5 meters (~16 feet 5 inches) high.</li>
                    <li> Mochas hands resemble more of a kangaroo than a wolf, he has fingers which gives him dexderity. </li>
                    <li> Mocha's tail is quite long, with the tip of the tail dragging on the ground. </li>
                </ul>
