            <header><h4> Who is Mocha Cinnamon? </h4></header>
            <p>
                Mocha is a character was created by Benjamin. Mocha is a hybrid of a Kangaroo and a wolf, making what is known as a wolfroo. Despite being of the male gender, Mocha has a pouch on his torso, and although it is deep it is not bottomless.
                In terms of where he came from, Mocha was born naturally between a female kangaroo and a male wolf (which I am aware it is an impossible senario that anything would happen like this in the real world, but this isnt in the real world :P). 
            </p>

            <h4>What Qualities of each side does Mocha inherit?</h4>
            <p>
               Excellent question! Well, his traits are a bit complicated. First of all, lets begin with the Kangaroo side. <br />Kangaroo:<br />

                <ul>
                    <li> Mocha has a pouch to hold his belongings in; Like a natural, attached pocket </li>
                    <li> Mocha has big, roo-like feet, which makes perfect for seamless hopping around and higher jumping ability. The highest Mocha has jumped is about 5 meters (~16 feet 5 inches) high.</li>
                    <li> Mochas hands resemble more of a kangaroo than a wolf, he has fingers which gives him dexderity. </li>
                    <li> Mocha's tail is quite long, with the tip of the tail dragging on the ground. </li>
                </ul>
                 
            </p>

            <h4> Who is Benjamin? (Who am I?)</h4>
            <p>
                Benjamin is the artist of all of the cartoons you see in the gallery. Some of the other amazing are was used with permission. Ben is currently a senior in high school, which makes drawing on a consistent schedule very tricky, if at all possible. Ben(jamin) has a very soft heart and has a tendency to feel apologetic about things that are much out of his control. He loves to be friends with people he meets and he is quick to forgive, however, if you manage to get on his bad side, it becomes hard for him to fully trust that person. This senario is rare but it has happened in the past.

            <h3> Does Mocha have a reference? </h3>
            <p>
                Heh.. heres the thing about that. Currently Mocha is a design flux. There is always something changing about him so there is no set version of Mocha that I can give to you and say it will stay like that for very long.
